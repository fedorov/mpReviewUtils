# mpReviewUtils

Utility library to parse mpReview-style directories and return a record for each segementation. 
It is hopefully usefull to access mpReview results in python scripts for convenient further processing.

The actual libary is in the subfolder "mpReviewUtils".

The subfolder "mpReviewUtilsCmdlTools" contains a few command line tools, this is still in an early stage and work in progress.

The subfolder "mpReviewUtilsTests" contains unit tests for the library. Run them via run_tests.bat 
(for non-windows users just do the appropriate call on the terminal, should be the same call as in the run_tests.bat)

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
